# Project E-Ink

- **Text-Based Launcher:** Minimalist interface with no colorful icons.
- **Reading Engine:** Built-in browser with Readability.js to strip clutter from web pages.
- **System Controller:** Global monochrome mode and red-tint filter for night use.

## Architecture
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose
- **DI:** Hilt
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Clean Architecture
